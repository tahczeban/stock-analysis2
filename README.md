***OVERVIEW:*** This challenge was generated to assist Steve with a stock market analysis for his parents using the VBS Stock Market Dataset, converting it to XLSM to, ultimately, expand the datset to the entire stock market over a period of years. To augment this analysis, Steve refactored the code to loop the same information in order to acquire the same result, hopefully, in a more efficient script run through, so that this can be applied to more stocks. Refactoring in this case is defined as follows: 

-not changing the data, but making the analysis more efficient (run through the script faster/fewer steps)

-utilizing less memory

-while improving the logic of the code

***RESULTS:***

***DELIVERABLE 1: Refactoe VBA Code and Measure Performance*** 

In this deliverable, the Module2_VBA_Script will be refactored through date one time and the data will be collected; hopefully faster and more efficiently via:
1. tickerIndex:(+) volumes, astartingPrices, EndingPrices
2. 'forloop to to loop rows
3. increaase TickerVolumes in for loop
4. if-then statement:last row  tickrIndex and Prices
5. script for increasing tickerIndex/not matching previous roe
6. for loopthrough the following arrays: tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStaringprices, tickerEndingPrices TO: Ticker/Total Daily Volume/Return on spreadsheet

***DELIVERQBLE 2: Written Analysis***

- repo with README

***SUMMARY:***
Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
