green energy DAQU, while expandinig the dataset for the last few years. To augment this analysis, Steve will refactor to loop same information 
refactoring  (not changing data, but making more efficient/less memory/improving logic of code)to loop through data to aquire same data,
in a more efficient script run through
written to present

_____________
***RESULTS:***

***DELIVERABLE 1: Refactoe VBA Code and Measure Performance*** 

In this deliverable, the Module2_VBA_Script will be refactored through date one time and the data will be collected; hopefully faster and more efficiently via:
1. tickerIndex:(+) volumes, astartingPrices, EndingPrices
2. 'forloop to to loop rows
3. increaase TickerVolumes in for loop
4. if-then statement:last row  tickrIndex and Prices
5. script for increasing tickerIndex/not matching previous roe
6. for loopthrough the following arrays: tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStaringprices, tickerEndingPrices TO: Ticker/Total Daily Volume/Return on spreadsheet
7 ==="popUP":elapsed time for 2017/2018
